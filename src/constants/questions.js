      text: "There are 12 identical looking coins among which 11 coins weigh the same and one is a counterfeit that is either heavier or lighter than the others. If you are given a balance scale which can only tell you if both side of scale are equal or if one side is heavier than the other. You may use the scale no more than three times and may write/mark on the coins with a marker which doesn't affect their weight. How will you identify the counterfeit?  ",
      answer: `First of all, you divide the coins in 3 equal piles meaning in groups of 4. Now first, you take one group of coins in one side and weigh them against another group of coins in the balance scale (1st time). There are 3 possibilities -
 If the balance scale shows weight of both side equal.
  If so, all 8 coins in the balance scale are real. 
  You can mark them as "O" so the fake must be among the remaining four.
   mark the real coins. 
   Take 3 of them and weigh them against the 3 of the remaining four unmarked coins (2nd time). if they balance again then the remaining last coin must be fake.
    If they dont:\n
	i. Draw a plus(+) if the unmarked coins are heavier or minus(-) if 	they are lighter.
   Now take the two of the newly marked coins and 	weigh them against each other(3rd time).
    If they are balanced the 	third coin is the fake. 
    If they dont just look at their marks. 
    if they are marked plus then the heavier one is fake otherwise if they 	are signed minus the lighter one is fake.
    b. If the balance scale shows different weight of the piles. If so, the coins not weighed are real so mark them as "O". 
    mark the heavier side coins plus and lighter side coins minus. Reassemble the piles. One way is to take one plus marked 
    coin and 3 minus marked coins together in one side against one minus coin and three known real coins together in another 
    side of the scale(2nd time). Now we have 3 possibilities:
    i. If the two sides balance then the three remaining plus coins 	contains the fake coin. weigh two of them against each other(3rd 	time), if they are balanced the third coin is counterfeit. if they 	are not then the heavier one is
    
    ii. If the side with one plus marked coin is heavier then either 	the plus coin in that side is heavier or the minus coin in another 	side is lighter i.e is fake. choose one of those coins and 	weigh it against a real coin(3rd time) to see which is true.
iii. If the side with only one minus coin is heavier then the side   	with 3 minus coin contains the fake coin. weigh two of them 	together(3rd time), if they are balanced the third coin is 	counterfeit. if they are not then the lighter one is.

      text: `There are three people Jeff, Ali and Mohan standing side to side. You meet them but don't know who is who.They play a game with you where you have to find who is who. You may ask three yes or no questions to any of them. They will answer you as "Sunny" or "Rainy" instead of "yes" or "no" but you don't know which one is yes and which one is no. Jeff always tells the truth, Ali always lies and Mohan answers randomly. You can ask multiple questions to same person. How will you find who is who?`,

      answer: `We actually don't need to know what word means yes or no and it doesnt matter. Ask the person in the middle "If I asked you whether the man on your left is Mohan, would you say Sunny?" The question is always true if he says "Sunny" and 
     always false if he says "Rainy". but there are two possibilities:
     i. You might be asking question to Mohan. In this case, the answer 	is meaningless.
	ii. You might be talking to Ali or Jeff. In this case the man on 	left must be Mohan if the answer is "Sunny" and one on the left	must not be Mohan if answer is "Rainy".
In both cases we know that one on the right is not Mohan if the answer was "sunny" and one on the left is not Mohan if the answer 	was "Rainy". So they must be Jeff or Ali hence they do not answer randomly. Again the question is always 
true if a truthteller or falseteller says "Sunny" and always false if he says "Rainy". Ask that non Mohan person, "If I ask you 'are you Jeff?' would you answer 'Sunny'?" From this question we know the identity of that person whether he is Jeff or Ali since we dont need to worry about the random answers. Again ask him, "If I ask you, 'is the man on the centre Mohan?' would you say 'Sunny'?" By this we can know the identity of the centre person and the remaining person. `,
